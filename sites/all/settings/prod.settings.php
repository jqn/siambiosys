/**
 * Fast 404 settings:

 * Fast 404 will do two separate types of 404 checking.
 *
 * The first is to check for URLs which appear to be files or images. If Drupal
 * is handling these items, then they were not found in the file system and are
 * a 404.
 *
 * The second is to check whether or not the URL exists in Drupal by checking
 * with the menu router, aliases and redirects. If the page does not exist, we
 * will server a fast 404 error and exit.

# Path checking at this phase is more dangerous, but faster. Normally
# Fast_404 will check paths during Drupal boostrap via hook_boot. Checking
# paths here is faster, but trickier as the Drupal database connections have
# not yet been made and the module must make a separate DB connection. Under
# most configurations this DB connection will be reused by Drupal so there
# is no waste.
# While this setting finds 404s faster, it adds a bit more load time to
# regular pages, so only use if you are spending too much CPU/Memory/DB on
# 404s and the trade-off is worth it.
# This setting will deliver 404s with less than 2MB of RAM.
