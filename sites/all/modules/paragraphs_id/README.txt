The Paragraphs ID module adds a unique CSS class (eg, .paragraphs-item-123) onto paragraph items. This allows a front-end developer to target a specific paragraph item using its entity ID.

## Installation

Using the module is fairly simple just enable it and you're good to go.

## Configuration

The default CSS class prefix is `paragraphs-item-`, however, this can be changed. Go to Configuration, Paragraphs ID (admin/config/system/paragraphs-id) and change the prefix.
