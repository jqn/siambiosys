The Image sub-module allows a user to add a background image to entities.

The module works by adding CSS directly into the HTML page.

`.paragraphs-item-3{background-image:url(http://example/images.jpg;}`

`.paragraphs-item-3{background-position:center center;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-size:cover;}`

## Installation

**Make sure you have followed the instructions in README.txt in the parent module.**

No extra modules are required.

## Change Image Style

The image style used for the background image can be changed by going to "admin/config/system/entity_background_image"
